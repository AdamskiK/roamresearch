    "\n",
    "0. __Product launch__: You have data on what doctors are prescribing during the period in which a new product is launched, and you want to cluster doctors based on the shape of their prescribing behavior in that period. An expert might draw different shapes in relation to the product launch (e.g., flat then rise after the launch, or rise then fall after the launch).\n",
    "\n",
    "0. __Differential burden of illness__: You have data on how different patients are responding to related treatments over time, and you want to cluster those patients to understand which characteristics associate with which shapes. Here, a doctor might draw on expert knowledge about disease progression and the nature of the treatments in specifying shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "0. __Beat the markets__: You have data on stock prices over time in a particular market, and you know certain model-based shapes are important (e.g., exponential increase), or an expert says that particular shapes are harbingers of price crashes.\n",

    "0. __Seismic warning signals__: You are a geophysicist looking for anomalies or outliers in seismic data that might signal an earthquake.

    "### Data pre-processing\n",
    "\n",
    "We can leave the raw sequences as-as and go directly to distance calculation, but it's often helpful to first transform the time-series sequences, to highlight trend-related information and/or reduce noise. Here's a brief review of such pre-processing methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Smoothing, standardization, and normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce noise, various kinds of __smoothing__ can be applied. Common choices are exponential smoothening, Holt's linear smoothening, moving averages, differencing, splines, and [LOESS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Standardization__ and __normalization__ are also commonly used in order to make the sequences more comparable. These two terms are sometimes used inter-changeably, but we should make a distinction: standardization forces the data to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1, whereas normalization scales the data to be in a specific range (often [0, 1]). Such steps will tend to erase differences of overall magnitude. This loss of information can be problematic or helpful, depending on the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Projecting the data onto a basis\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we project the data $Y$ onto a basis $W$ in order to represent the data in a new data space $T$, which is calculated by $YW$. These methods can be used to compress the data into a smaller space than before by reducing the dimensionality of $W$. This process is known as dimensionality reduction.  Prominent examples are [Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis), [Truncated Singular Value Decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition) (also known as [Latent Semantic Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis)), [Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform),  [Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform), and [Wavelet Transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelet_transform).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, basis methods can appear when you don't expect it. For example, the coefficients from linear models, such as linear regression or [Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average), can take the form of a basis method. Let's take linear regression as an example. Suppose $y$ is the sequence of interest, and $X$ denotes some time-related features. The linear regression model for each sequence is as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "y = X\\beta = X (X^{\\top} X)^{-1} X^{\\top} y\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the coefficients denoted by $\\beta$ are obtained by projecting y onto the basis $(X^{\\top} X)^{-1} X^{\\top}$.\n",

    "#### String representations with SAX\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most interesting and promising representation methods we have explored at Roam is [Symbolic Aggregate approXimation](http://cs.gmu.edu/~jessica/SAX_DAMI_preprint.pdf) (SAX), an extension of Symbolic Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA). SAX offers a symbolic approach to shape matching: given a time series of some length $n$, SAX reduces it to a string of arbitrary length $w$ where $w \\leq n$. For making comparisons, this is  extremely efficient, since it greatly reduces the dimensionality of the original sequence; one can view it as an aggressive form of smoothing. We find SAX useful when needing to store large numbers of sequences compactly. The downside is that one loses detailed information about each sequence; it is sometimes difficult to faithfully represent complex shape archetypes using SAX. In order to calculate the distance between two sequences, SAX uses its own method, known as MINDIST which is explained at the end of [the following section](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/2016-08-15-shape_matching/shape_matching_blog.ipynb#Calculating-Distance). \n",
    "\n",
    "The `SAXModel` class of the `pysax` Python package implements the sequence-to-string conversion with its `symbolize` method, and the distance measure with its `symbol_distance` method. ([Here's a helpful tutorial](https://github.com/dolaameng/pysax/blob/master/Tutorial-SAX%20(Symbolic%20Aggregate%20Approximation.ipynb).) For R, `SAX`, `TSclust` and `TSdist` have implementations of SAX and MINDIST. For the examples below, `TSdist` was used via the `rpy2` python interface."

    "### Calculating distance\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have pre-processed the sequences, we need a measure or numerical value for the distance between the two pre-processed sequences, in order to assess how similar the two time series curves are.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common distance measures\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguably the most common distance measure is the $L_2$ norm, otherwise known as the Euclidean distance. Here, the distance between two sequences or vectors $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{y}$ of dimension $n$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "||\\bar{x} âˆ’ \\bar{y}||^{2} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}|x_{i}-y_{i}|^{2}}\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Mahalanobis distance and cosine distance, though not identical, are both related to  Euclidean distance and also commonly used. \n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation measures can also be used as distance measures, as the correlation measure is inversely proportional to the distance between the two sequences.  Pearson's correlation coefficient is an example of a parametric correlation measure, and Spearman and Kendall rank-based correlation are non-parametric correlation measures. Non-parametric methods can pick non-linear trends and are robust against outliers. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the data has been transformed into a string representation, edit distance measures such as Longest Common Subsequence can be used. [Here](http://www.ece.northwestern.edu/~peters/references/vldb08.pdf) is a good reference for some of these techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's `scipy.spatial.distance` offers many distance methods and `scipy.stats` implements a wide range of correlation methods. R's `cluster` and `stringdist` implement the above measures as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### FrÃ©chet distance and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)\n",
    "\n",
    "FrÃ©chet distance is also called \"man walks dog\" or \"dog walks man\" distance because of the colorful way it is often described. Imagine a person walking along one sequence and their dog walking in the same direction along another. Each can walk at any speed (even stop), but they cannot go backwards. The FrÃ©chet distance between the two sequences is the length of the shortest leash that could connect them. For a thorough discussion of the math behind this, check out [these helpful notes](http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~athens/cs507/Projects/2002/StephanePelletier/).\n",
    "\n",
    "FrÃ©chet distance does not require the sequences being compared to have the same length, and it also doesn't assume that specific dimensions can be compared. Rather, the method implicitly aligns the two sequences as part of the comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Time Warning (DTW) is similar to FrÃ©chet distance. Here again, we seek an optimal alignment between the two shapes without assuming that the underlying processes happened at the same speed or for the same amount of time. In other words, the DTW algorithm __stretches__ or __compresses__ two non-linear sequences in making its comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"fig/dtw_v3.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"60\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two sequences: a red colored curve __A__ and a shorter blue colored curve __B__. The shapes of these two curves look similar. However, they are out of phase, and __B__ is shorter than __A__. The DTW algorithm can warp these two curves by time-aligning the sequences (as depicted by the black arrows), making it possible to find similarities between sequences that have differences in length, are not in phase, and/or are warped representations of each other. To prevent the number of such  __warping functions__ from growing too large, they are typically constrained to be monotonic and continuous, with further restrictions placed on their slopes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Python `dtw` package implements Dynamic Time Warping.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MINDIST for SAX\n",
    "\n",
    "SAX, discussed [above](#String-representations-with-SAX), uses its own distance method:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\textrm{MINDIST}(\\hat{Q}, \\hat{C}) =  \\sqrt\\frac{n}{w} \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^w\\left(\\textbf{dist}(\\hat q_i, \\hat c_i)\\right)^{2}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, $Q$ and $C$ are the two sequences or series of interest, and $\\hat Q$ and $\\hat C$ denote the transformed string versions of the original sequences, $\\hat q_i$ is the $i^{th}$ character of the transformed sequence $Q$ (and similarly $\\hat c_i$), $n$ is the length of each sequence, $w$ is the length of the string which the sequence will be reduced to (aka as breakpoints), and $\\textbf{dist}$ is calculated using a look-up table based on the breakpoints $w$."
